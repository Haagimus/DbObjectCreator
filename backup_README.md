# Project DaVInCI

##### Project Name:
- **Da**ta **V**isualization **In**tegration and **C**harts **I**nterface **(DaVInCI)**
---
##### Team Members:
- Kristen Morton - PM
- Gary Haag - POC
- Tim Grey
- Yoseph Ali Beki

##### Project Goal:
- ~~Reproduce Logi capability with enhanced security and better data visualizations~~
- Create a reusable API for data access which will be expandible to support data queries and analysis
---
##### Outstanding questions:
- What data do we need in order to report the desired information?
- What is the desired information?
- Where does the data come from?
    - I believe most of the information we need will come from Scribe?
- What is our timeline?
- What is the definition of done/MVP/BFM?
- How is the destinations dashboard page hosted?
    - This information will be needed in order to determine how/if the Dash application will be a suitable solution for adding into an existing server. I imagine it will just need to determine how.
- How are product requirements being generated?
- Who will be the Product Owner?
- Where will the requirements live and be processed through the proper workflow?
    - I suppose in lieu of a proper requirements manager we can use an excel spreadsheet to document what we need, thoughts?

##### Misc Notes:
- Logi does not meet security standards
- Does not segregate data for users vs devs
- Keep calendar component, with the exception of click the calendar icon instead of just numbers to get the modal
- Possibly developed in Python using Dash and integrating in conjunction with .js and D3 elements, planning to reuse as many existing custom elements as possible with tweaks for design and functionality if needed. (MTF after design meetings)
